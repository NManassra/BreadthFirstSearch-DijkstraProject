# BreadthFirstSearch-DijkstraProject
simple GPS system that allows users to find the shortest routes between cities using both Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS.
 It reads city data from a file, calculates distances, and provides options to input source and destination cities while displaying the shortest path and saving the results to a file.
